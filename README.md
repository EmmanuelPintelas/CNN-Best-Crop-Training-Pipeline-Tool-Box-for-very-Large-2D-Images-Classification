# CNN-Training-Pipeline-Tool-Box-for-very-Large-2D-Images-Classification



In this project, we mainly provide 4 training-optimization pipelines for CNN models
emphasizing on very large images, but it can be used as a general tool.

The first one is a traditional training pipeline  _Train Loop_, which iteratively
trains and save the best validated model.

The second one is  _Train Loop Augments_, which automatically activates random train augmentations
only when the training accuracy becomes too high, in order to add regularlization effect during training to avoid overfitting 
and also boost even more the validation performance.
